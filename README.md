Matrix Rotator
===========

Write the **rotate** method of the **MatrixRotator** class that accepts one argument, **direction**.  
**rotate** must set the object's **matrix** property with a new, rotated matrix.

There are **2** tests, make the tests pass.

    npm install jasmine-node -g

run automated tests by running
    jasmine-node --autotest .
